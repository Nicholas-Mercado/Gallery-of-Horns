### Comments

I learned some of the basics of React and using properties. It felt good. So far react is pretty intuitive and easy to write. Kind of what I have been looking for since salmon cookies.

### Comments 2

Today was a crash course rendering information from a JSON file, implementing state changes, and using bootstrap to make my page more responsive. I found that by going back and working through my cod a little slower I was able to come to a better understanding of how it worked. I also notice that fixing bugs gave me the best understanding of the intricacies of how the code worked. That involved taking a little more time to understand why the bug fixed worked instead of just moving on and being happy that it just worked.

### Comments

Today I implemented a Modal and refactored my code for efficiency. For implementing a Modal I found it quite intuitive. I was able to send a few functions into Main and update state in App. When It came to refactoring my code I found that much more challenging. While I understand the high-level concepts of where data comes and goes I have a tenuous grasp on data flow when it actually comes to working with code. I feel that this will become clearer to me with more code reviews.

### Comments

Today, I learned how to create a drop-down selector and create the logic to filter my images using key names in my data. I pushed myself a little today by making the filter its own component. One this is very much in the spirit of React and from what I understand its industry standard. Industry-standard is what I need to aim for the rest of this Boot-camp. Second I am still a little iffy on how React passes data. I understood the birds-eye view but when it came to the code I would get turned around. This really helps me make some big steps forward in understanding when you use prop and when to use state. I also had a big ah-ha moment when I started to visualize how to data from component to child component in the code.
