### Comments

I learned some of the basics of React and using properties. It felt good. So far react is pretty intuitive and easy to write. Kind of what I have been looking for since salmon cookies.

### Comments 2

Today was a crash course rendering information from a JSON file, implementing state changes, and using bootstrap to make my page more responsive. I found that by going back and working through my cod a little slower I was able to come to a better understanding of how it worked. I also notice that fixing bugs gave me the best understanding of the intricacies of how the code worked. That involved taking a little more time to understand why the bug fixed worked instead of just moving on and being happy that it just worked.
